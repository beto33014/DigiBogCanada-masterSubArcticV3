# DigiBog SubArctic
Base model files for DigiBog_Congo. The initial commit includes the (at the time) most recent model files for northern peatlands before being adapted for the Congo Basin.
The main model file includes the fixes for mass remaining calculation in the lumping routine and to recalculate layer K after the lumping routine.
